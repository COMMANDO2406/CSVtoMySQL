# Introduction

Welcome to the CSV to MySQL project documentation.

This project allows you to import data from a CSV file into a MySQL database. It connects to a MySQL server, checks if the specified database exists (and creates it if it doesn't), then creates a table and imports data from the CSV file into that table.
